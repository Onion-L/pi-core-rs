# pi-core-rs

**A standalone Rust runtime for Pi's agent, AI, and telemetry core**

<p>
  <code>Rust 2024</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <code>v0.84.4 compatibility target</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <code>No Node.js runtime</code>
</p>

</div>

`pi-core-rs` is a Rust port of `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `pi-ai`, and
`pi-telemetry` v0.84.4. It provides the same core building blocks as a native
Rust library, plus a small `pi-ai` command-line binary for OAuth credentials.

> **Project status — experimental, actively maintained**
>
> This is an experimental port, not a finalized production release. It is
> maintained steadily with compatibility tests, serialized-output goldens, and
> the upstream TypeScript sources as a behavioral oracle. Public APIs may still
> evolve as the port matures.

## What it provides

| Layer | Capabilities | Rust entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Telemetry** | Nested spans, attributes, events, status, typed schemas, in-memory and no-op backends | `pi_core::telemetry` |
| **AI** | Provider-neutral streaming, normalized events, tool calls, images, reasoning, usage and cost accounting | `pi_core::ai` |
| **Authentication** | Environment-based API keys, credential stores, OAuth flows, provider-specific auth resolution | `pi_core::ai::auth` |
| **Agent** | Async prompt loop, mutable state, lifecycle events, tool execution, steering, follow-ups, cancellation, and continuation | `pi_core::agent::agent::Agent` |
| **Harness** | Memory and JSONL sessions, branches and lanes, reduction, compaction, summaries, skills, templates, search, and filesystem tools | `pi_core::agent::harness` |
| **CLI** | List OAuth providers and save OAuth credentials to `auth.json` | `pi-ai` |

The crate is designed to run without Node.js at build time or runtime. The
TypeScript tree under `pi-core/` is kept as a read-only specification and test
oracle for the Rust implementation.

## AI provider support

The provider layer includes adapters for:

- Anthropic Messages
- OpenAI Chat Completions, Responses, and Codex Responses
- Azure OpenAI Responses
- Google Generative AI and Google Vertex AI
- Mistral Conversations
- Amazon Bedrock Converse Stream
- Pi Messages
- Cloudflare AI Gateway and Workers AI
- OpenRouter image generation
- Radius and a broad set of OpenAI-compatible providers, including DeepSeek,
  Groq, Cerebras, Together, Fireworks, NVIDIA, Moonshot, MiniMax, Xiaomi,
  Qwen, Z.AI, OpenCode, Hugging Face, and others

Provider features include SSE normalization, partial tool-argument handling,
thinking blocks, stop reasons, retries, cancellation, context overflow
handling, deferred responses, prompt-cache metadata, and usage accounting.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer
- Network access only for live provider requests or OAuth flows
- Node.js 22.19 or newer only when running the TypeScript oracle suites

Node.js is not required to build or run the Rust crate.

### Build and run the offline examples

From the repository root:

```bash
cargo build

# In-memory telemetry with nested spans
cargo run --example telemetry_basic

# A scripted agent turn using the credential-free faux provider
cargo run --example agent_core_basic
```

The agent example also records the conversation as a v4 JSONL session in a
temporary directory and prints the persisted records.

The examples are available in [`examples/`](examples/):

- [`telemetry_basic.rs`](examples/telemetry_basic.rs) — basic span creation
- [`agent_core_basic.rs`](examples/agent_core_basic.rs) — agent events, a faux
  provider, and JSONL session persistence

## Use it as a library

For a local checkout, add the crate as a path dependency. The package is named
`pi-core-rs`, while the Rust crate is imported as `pi_core`.

```toml
[dependencies]
pi-core-rs = { path = "../pi-core-rs" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

The smallest deterministic agent uses the built-in faux provider, so it needs
no credentials or network access:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use pi_core::agent::agent::{Agent, AgentOptions};
use pi_core::ai::compat::{register_faux_provider, stream_simple};
use pi_core::ai::providers::faux::{
    faux_assistant_message, FauxMessageOptions, FauxResponseStep,
    RegisterFauxProviderOptions,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    let faux = register_faux_provider(RegisterFauxProviderOptions::default());
    faux.set_responses(vec![FauxResponseStep::Message(Box::new(
        faux_assistant_message("Hello from pi-core-rs", FauxMessageOptions::default()),
    ))]);

    let agent = Agent::new(AgentOptions {
        stream_fn: Some(Arc::new(|model, context, options| {
            Ok(stream_simple(model, context, options))
        })),
        ..Default::default()
    });

    agent.set_model(faux.get_model());
    agent.prompt("Say hello").await?;
    println!("messages: {}", agent.messages().len());
    Ok(())
}
```

For a real provider, replace the faux stream with a `Models` or compatibility
stream and select a model from the generated catalog:

```rust
use pi_core::ai::providers::builtin::get_builtin_models;

let model = get_builtin_models("anthropic")
    .into_iter()
    .next()
    .expect("the provider catalog contains at least one model");
```

## Use API keys or OAuth

API-key providers read their configured environment variables. Common examples
are:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
# or:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

The provider registry contains the complete provider-to-environment-variable
mapping. API keys can also be supplied through the Rust request/auth types.

The `pi-ai` binary handles the built-in OAuth flows:

```bash
# Show the available OAuth commands and providers
cargo run --bin pi-ai -- help
cargo run --bin pi-ai -- list

# Start an interactive OAuth flow
cargo run --bin pi-ai -- login openai-codex
```

OAuth credentials are merged into `auth.json` in the current working
directory. Keep that file out of version control. The exact provider list is
available from `pi-ai list`; it currently includes Anthropic, GitHub Copilot,
Kimi For Coding, OpenAI Codex, OpenRouter, Radius, and xAI.

## Sessions, tools, and compaction

The harness layer exposes the lower-level pieces needed to build a coding or
workflow agent:

- memory-backed sessions for fast tests and ephemeral runs;
- v4 JSONL session storage with branching, lanes, metadata, and usage records;
- deterministic state reduction and record-log validation;
- context-token estimation, compaction preparation, and branch summaries;
- `bash`, `read`, `write`, and `edit` tools over a Node-compatible execution
  environment;
- prompt-template and skill loaders, resource formatting, and session search;
- telemetry schemas and helpers for AI requests and harness operations.

The high-level `AgentHarness` v2 contract is present. Operations that are still
scaffolded by the upstream contract intentionally return explicit
`HarnessNotImplemented` or `HarnessClosed` errors instead of pretending to be
available. The lower-level session, tool, compaction, reducer, and resource
modules are independently exposed and tested.

```

## Verification

Run the focused examples while developing, then the full Rust checks:

```bash
cargo test --all-targets
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Provider integration tests are credential-gated and skip cleanly when the
required credentials are absent. The full port status and documented runtime
differences are tracked in [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).
